Hello! 
I'm Imaan, I'm from Oakland, CA and a recent graduate from Columbia University's with my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I previously attained my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace and Astronautical Engineering from Purdue University. I have a diverse set of academic and professional experiences that have given me a background across software and hardware engineering. This website serves as my portfolio of those projects.

I'm currently seeking full-time employment and can be contacted at my email.
