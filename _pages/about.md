Hello! I'm Imaan, I'm from Oakland, CA and a recent graduate from Columbia University's with my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I previously attained my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace and Astronautical Engineering from Purdue University. I have a diverse set of academic and professional experiences that have given me a background across software and hardware engineering. This website serves as my portfolio of those projects.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
