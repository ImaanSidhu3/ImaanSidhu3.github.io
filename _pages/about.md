Hello! 
I'm Imaan, I'm from Oakland, CA and a recent graduate from Columbia University with my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I previously attained my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace and Astronautical Engineering from Purdue University. I have a diverse set of academic and professional experiences that have given me a background across software and hardware engineering. This website serves as my portfolio of those projects.

I'm currently employed as an Analyst at Entuber Strategy focusing on Artifical Intelligence. My ongoing projects are related to customer service chatbots, specifically training agents on datasets to increase response accuracy. I am still seeking full-time employment and can be contacted at my email, available at the bottom of this page.
