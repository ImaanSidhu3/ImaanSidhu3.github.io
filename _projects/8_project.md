This project showcases the implementation of a Tic Tac Toe AI designed to play the game optimally using the minimax algorithm. The AI ensures it always makes the best possible move, making it impossible for an opponent to win if the AI starts or plays perfectly. This project highlights the principles of game theory, recursion, and decision-making in zero-sum games.





This project honed my skills in Python, Pygame, and AI concepts like logical reasoning and minimax serving as a stepping stone toward tackling more complex game-solving AIs like chess.
