This is an ongoing project to build a lamp that I saw while travelling in Japan. The original lamp was made out of wood and roughly 18 inches in height. Originally I planned on 3D-printing my version, but later felt that working with wood would be a new challenge. I've currently finished the first draft of the CAD models in Solidworks. Going forward I'd like to refine the design to make it slightly more anthropomorphic but still reasonable to manufacture. I'll then look into materials and machining.
