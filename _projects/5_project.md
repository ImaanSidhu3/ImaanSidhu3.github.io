This is an ongoing project of mine to build this lamp that I saw while travelling in Japan. The original lamp was made out of wood and roughly 18 inches in height. Originally I planned on 3D-printing a version, but felt that working with wood would be a new challenge. I've currently finished the first draft of the CAD models in Solidworks. Going forward I'd like to refine the design to make it slightly more anthropomorphic and reasonable to manufacture.
